## Functional Requirements

Your task is to create an application that shows the user an image of each exercise, a tip on how to perform the exercise well, and an interface that allows the user to input their results as they go along. 

You should only display one exercise at a time. 

It should be required from the user to update the score of the current exercise before being able to move on to the next one.

On this repository you will find the img/ folder containing the images for each exercise and also a JSON object containing the name, scores, and one tip to perform each exercise better. You can modify this JSON file to accommodate things like the image_url to your file structure and preferences.
 
For each exercise score_1 awards 1 point; score_2 awards 2 points; and score_3 awards 3 points.

Each time they add a result the app their current score should update 

When they reach the end of the test you should let them know whether or not they could become a professional Jockey.
