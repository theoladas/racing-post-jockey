# What will you build?: The Racing Post Jockey Challenge App
 
One of our sister brands, the Racing Post, has put together a marketing campaign to attract readership engagement, ahead of an upcoming Horse Racing event.

To achieve this, they have produced a video piece where a professional Jockey explains five  exercises of the physical test they need to pass to become professional.

You can watch the video here.

The idea of this piece is to encourage the audience to take the test themselves, see how they perform and post their results on social media.

## Functional Requirements

Your task is to create an application that shows the user an image of each exercise, a tip on how to perform the exercise well, and an interface that allows the user to input their results as they go along. 

You should only display one exercise at a time. 

It should be required from the user to update the score of the current exercise before being able to move on to the next one.

On this repository you will find the img/ folder containing the images for each exercise and also a JSON object containing the name, scores, and one tip to perform each exercise better. You can modify this JSON file to accommodate things like the image_url to your file structure and preferences.
 
For each exercise score_1 awards 1 point; score_2 awards 2 points; and score_3 awards 3 points.

Each time they add a result the app their current score should update 

When they reach the end of the test you should let them know whether or not they could become a professional Jockey.

## Visual requirements

Ideally, the app should be responsive and adapt to mobile displays. 
 
You are free to make any aesthetical decisions about the look of the tool, however, we encourage you to try to build something that you think would look good on the racingpost.com website.  

## Other specifications

You are encouraged to use a reactive Javascript framework, in particular Vue.js. However, feel free to use any framework of your choice or build it in vanilla Javascript. Itâ€™s up to you!

## Delivery
